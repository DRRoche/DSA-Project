# Sparse Matrices w/Linked Lists - DSA-Project
## Summary
For our Project this spring, we were tasked with creating Sparse Matrices using Linked List, a data structure we previously learned about earlier in the semester. In addition to creating the classes for the matrices, we were tasked to add some mathematical operations such as Matrix Multiplication and Matrix Addition. Lastly, we implemented logic to load in the matricies from text files within the same directory as the files.
